Journal Entry #17 - 2124-04-01

91 days since my last entry, and I'm still marveling at the vastness of this galaxy. Today was a day that will be etched in my memory forever.

As I emerged from cryosleep, the harsh reality of Zardon's environment slapped me in the face. The ice-cold air stung my skin, and the perpetual darkness seemed to swallow all hope. My ship's sensors told me it was -50°C outside, and I couldn't help but wonder if I'd made a grave mistake by venturing here.

But, as always, curiosity got the better of me. I suited up and stepped out onto the frozen surface. The crunch of my boots on the ice was the only sound in an otherwise deafening silence. The landscape stretched out before me like an endless graveyard, with ancient glaciers scraping against the sky. Every step felt like a declaration of defiance against the unforgiving environment.

As I explored, I stumbled upon strange, twisted structures jutting out from the ice. They seemed to be some sort of natural formations, yet their shapes defied explanation. Were they some ancient geological phenomenon? Or perhaps the result of some unknown alien civilization's handiwork? My mind is still reeling with the possibilities.

As the day wore on, I began to notice a strange, pulsating energy emanating from one of these structures. It was like nothing I'd ever encountered before – almost... familiar. Without hesitation, I approached the site and began to scan its surface using my suit's built-in sensors.

The readings were inconclusive, but something about this place resonated with me. Perhaps it's the sense of discovery that comes with uncovering secrets long hidden beneath the ice. Or maybe it's the feeling of being on the cusp of unraveling a mystery that has been waiting for eons.

As I write these words, my ship is now orbiting Zardon at a safe distance. The darkness outside feels almost... comforting, knowing that I've left a piece of myself here, waiting to be rediscovered.

This day has reminded me that even in the most inhospitable environments, there lies beauty and wonder. And as a space explorer, it's my duty to seek out these secrets, no matter how daunting the journey may seem.

Until next time, when I'll venture further into the unknown...
