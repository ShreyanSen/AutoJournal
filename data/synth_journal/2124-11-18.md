Journal Entry #84 - 2124-11-18

It's been 322 days since I set out on this journey, and yet every day feels like an eternity. Today was no exception. As I ventured deeper into the warm waters of Myros, I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and awe at the sheer diversity of life that surrounds me.

My ship's charts indicate that I'm currently hovering near the equatorial region of this planet, where the water temperature is just right for a curious space explorer like myself. As I descended into the depths, my suit's lights illuminated a kaleidoscope of colors - iridescent fish darting past me, their scales shimmering in the dim light; giant kelp forests swaying gently in the currents; and schools of bioluminescent creatures lighting up the darkness like tiny stars.

But it wasn't just the visual feast that left me breathless. As I explored the seafloor, I stumbled upon a peculiar creature - a being unlike any I've seen before. It had six long, sinuous tentacles that seemed to be exploring the surrounding environment, searching for something or someone. Its body was a gelatinous mass, pulsing with a soft blue light that pulsed in sync with the rhythm of my own heartbeat.

I watched, mesmerized, as it slowly approached me, its tentacles probing the water around me. For a moment, I felt a sense of unease - would this creature be friendly or hostile? But then, something unexpected happened. It began to change color, shifting from blue to green and finally to a deep crimson. The color shift seemed to be... communicating with me?

I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of connection to this being. For the first time in what feels like an eternity, I felt truly seen. As if this creature had looked into my very soul and understood me on some fundamental level.

As I continued to observe it, I realized that Myros is not just a planet - it's a gateway to understanding the mysteries of the universe. The creatures here are not just beautiful; they're gatekeepers of secrets, whispering truths to those who take the time to listen.

Today was a day of revelations, of feeling small yet connected to something much greater than myself. As I look out at the stars, I know that my journey is far from over. But for now, I'll bask in the glow of this encounter, knowing that there's still so much to discover and learn on this wondrous planet called Myros.

Until tomorrow,

Battuta
