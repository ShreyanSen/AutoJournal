**Journal Entry 47 - 2124-07-15**

196 days since the last entry... it feels like an eternity ago that I was drifting through the Orion Nebula, searching for answers. Today, my trusty ship, The Celestial Nomad, brought me to a place that's as infamous as it is notorious: Last Call.

As we entered the space port, I could sense the weight of uncertainty hanging in the air like a thick fog. My charts warned me about this place - unregulated and open to all manner of scoundrels, smugglers, and opportunists. But I had to come here. A tip from an old contact led me to believe that a rare, ancient artifact might be hidden among the shadows.

I spent most of the day navigating the cramped corridors and dodgy cantinas, trying to gather information without drawing attention to myself. The air reeks of desperation and cheap liquor, but I kept my wits about me, making small talk with the locals and listening for whispers of rumors.

It's funny - in a place like this, people are more likely to tell you their deepest secrets than share the weather forecast. I learned that a rival smuggler has been searching for the same artifact I am, and will stop at nothing to get it. The thrill of the hunt is intoxicating, but also treacherous.

As the sun set on Last Call (if one can even call this desolate rock a "sunset"), I found myself face-to-face with an old acquaintance - a shady character known only as "The Viper." We negotiated a deal that left me feeling uneasy, yet hopeful. The artifact might be closer than I thought.

In the chaos of this lawless space port, I've come to realize that sometimes the greatest discoveries are made in the darkest corners of existence. Last Call may not be the most glamorous destination, but it's taught me to trust my instincts and keep a close eye on my surroundings.

The stars outside are shining brighter than ever, and I know that tomorrow will bring new challenges and opportunities. As I set down my pen and look out at the vast expanse of space, I'm reminded that even in the most treacherous of places, there's always room to grow and learn.
