**Journal Entry 43**

Date: 2124-07-05

Location: Last Call, Unregulated Space Port

186 days since first entry...

Today was a day of contrasts. I arrived at Last Call earlier this morning, seeking information on a lead about a rare space artifact rumored to be hidden somewhere in the port. As I docked my ship, the Aurora's Hope, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The air here is thick with the smell of smoke and desperation.

As I made my way through the crowded corridors, I was approached by various shady characters, all trying to sell me something or offer their services. It's a wonder anyone can trust each other in this place. I've heard stories about Last Call being a haven for smugglers, pirates, and black marketers. The port's reputation precedes it, but I needed to see it for myself.

I spent the morning gathering information from various sources – whispers, rumors, and half-truths. It seems my lead is genuine, but the artifact might be hidden in one of the many abandoned ships scattered throughout the port. I've managed to make contact with a local smuggler who claims to have knowledge about the artifact's location. He wants something in return, naturally.

As the day wore on, I found myself feeling anxious and frustrated. The constant noise, the smell of smoke, and the endless haggling took its toll. I retreated to my ship for some much-needed quiet time, reflecting on the past few months. It's been 186 days since I left Earth, and I've seen so many incredible things – stars, planets, alien species... But it's moments like these that remind me of the harsh realities of space travel.

Despite the chaos and uncertainty surrounding me, I feel a sense of determination growing within me. This artifact might be my ticket to understanding more about the mysteries of the cosmos. And who knows? It could also lead me to new discoveries, new worlds to explore...

As I sit here in the silence of my ship, I'm reminded that even in the darkest corners of space, there's always hope. The stars will align in their own time; it's up to me to navigate the shadows and find my way.

Tomorrow, I'll meet with my contact and see if we can strike a deal. Who knows what adventures await?
