**Battuta's Journal Entry 25 - April 28, 2124**

118 days since my first entry, and I'm still marveling at the vastness of this universe. Today was a day that will stay with me for a long time.

As I ventured out onto Zardon's unforgiving surface, my suit's temperature control struggled to keep up with the biting chill. The ice stretched out before me like an endless sea, punctuated only by jagged rock formations and the occasional ice cave. My ship's scans hinted at underground aquifers, but I've yet to find any sign of liquid water on this frozen world.

My mission today was to investigate a peculiar energy signature detected by my ship's sensors. As I explored the surface, I stumbled upon an ancient structure - or what's left of it. The ice had encased the ruins in a protective shell, preserving the details for millennia. I spent hours excavating and documenting the site. The technology on display was unlike anything I've seen before; it's as if Zardon's ancient inhabitants were attempting to harness the planet's energy in ways both familiar and yet, utterly alien.

As the sun dipped below the horizon (or what passes for a sun on this dark world), I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder. How did these long-lost civilizations thrive on such a hostile environment? What secrets lie buried beneath my feet? The more I learn about Zardon, the more I realize how little we know.

As night falls on this unforgiving planet, I'm reminded that even in the face of uncertainty and isolation, there's beauty in the unknown. My suit's lights illuminate the darkness, casting an otherworldly glow on the ice. It's a small comfort, but it's mine.

Tomorrow, I'll continue to explore Zardon, searching for answers and perhaps, just perhaps, uncovering new secrets that will take my understanding of this universe to new heights.

P.S. The stars are incredibly bright tonight.
