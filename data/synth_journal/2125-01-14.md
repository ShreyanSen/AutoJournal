Journal Entry 97 - 2125-01-14

379 days since the first entry... Hard to believe how fast time flies when you're lost in the vastness of space.

Today was a day I'll never forget on this warm water world, Myros. As I emerged from my ship's cockpit, the bright blue light of the dual suns hit me like a slap in the face, reminding me that even in the depths of space, there's always something new to discover.

My first encounter was with a majestic creature that can only be described as a "glimmerwing." Its iridescent wings refracted the sunlight into tiny rainbows, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across my ship. It glided effortlessly above me, its long tail undulating like a metronome. I felt like I was witnessing a celestial ballet. The creature's gentle curiosity drew me in, and I spent hours observing it, learning about its migration patterns and the intricate social dynamics within its school.

As the day wore on, my ship's sensors detected an unusual energy signature emanating from a nearby reef system. My curiosity piqued, I donned my diving suit and ventured into the crystal-clear waters to investigate. The reef teemed with life, and I marveled at the sheer diversity of species. Giant sea fans swayed like giant tentacles, while schools of bioluminescent fish darted past me like tiny stars.

As I explored the reef, I stumbled upon a peculiar structure â€“ an ancient underwater city, hidden beneath the waves for millennia. The crumbling architecture was covered in coral and anemones, yet still exuded an aura of mystique. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I pondered the secrets this city held.

Today's discoveries have left me with more questions than answers. What purpose did this ancient civilization serve? How did they manage to build such structures beneath the waves? And what happened to them?

As the dual suns set on Myros, casting a warm orange glow over the reef, I'm reminded that there's always more to learn, more mysteries to unravel. The thrill of exploration never grows old.

Time for a well-deserved rest, but tomorrow will bring new wonders to uncover, no doubt.
